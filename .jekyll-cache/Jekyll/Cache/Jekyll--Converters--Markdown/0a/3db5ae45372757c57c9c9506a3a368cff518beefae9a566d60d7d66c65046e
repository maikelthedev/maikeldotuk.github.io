<p>Why do I feel the most lonely when Iâ€™m with people? Why do I never feel alone when Iâ€™m actually, physically, alone?</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve just finished watching the movie â€œCall me by your nameâ€. I canâ€™t form an opinion on it yet, I like the dialogue of the father with the son, it might probably be the most important highlight of the movie. Especially the part of not numbing your emotions to stop feeling pain because youâ€™ll also stop feeling happiness. Thatâ€™s me. Iâ€™ve numbed my emotions so, so much that some days I barely feel a thing.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve got an interesting skill, apart from learning really really quickly I can erase memories. I canâ€™t barely remember anything from my relationship with David, my first love, because bearing the pain of having lost him was so overwhelming that I blocked it out after first trying to deal with it for over a year after we broke up.</p>

<p>I felt I was wasting time, our only valuable currency, and I needed to get my life sorted and <strong>feeling</strong> was just preventing me from moving on so I detached. Iâ€™ve never been the same ever since.</p>

<p>I struggle sometimes to understand how I feel. Many times I need a few days just to get the basics of whatâ€™s going on in my emotional life. I have so much practice at detaching than re-attaching has become the hard part.</p>

<p>Also while I can erase memories what I canâ€™t do is to target just the bad ones. I canâ€™t barely remember any good memory with David too.</p>

<p>Sometimes I fear Iâ€™m becoming hollow, all that is left is the shell. <strong>I want to feel alive.</strong></p>

<p>I want my life to get better. I want Sundays to stop being painful. I want economic certainty and a stable job, I want a network of friends who arenâ€™t just passing by, I want so many things to get better. I wonâ€™t stop until they are.</p>
