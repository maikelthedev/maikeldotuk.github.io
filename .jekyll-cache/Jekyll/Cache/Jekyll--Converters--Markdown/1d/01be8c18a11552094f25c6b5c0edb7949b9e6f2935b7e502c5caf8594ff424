I"â<p>So, I havenâ€™t written in a while because I have to prepare for the exam of TM354 so postponed the project work until I was past that exam.</p>

<p>Now that I am free I can go back to this project.</p>

<p>The next step is to build the front-end. By this time I would have written it, tested it and moved onto creating the elastic cloud by code. There has no been time for it so I will have to discard writing it by code and do it using the assistant Iâ€™m afraid. Itâ€™s a trade-off.</p>

<p>On the good side at work I had a similar project so my Angular knowledge is fresh on my mind.</p>

<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Create the front-end project â€œng new frontendâ€</li>
  <li>Push it to github to have it backed-up.</li>
  <li>Keep both front-end and back-end running.</li>
  <li>Add bootstrap to the project so it doesnâ€™t look ugly.</li>
  <li>Create the login page.</li>
  <li>Create the lists page.</li>
  <li>Create and amend job applications.</li>
  <li>Find how to integrate finding distances.</li>
  <li>Created google APIâ€™s key.</li>
  <li>Applied the Google Maps API in the backend to save the distances.</li>
  <li>Added the facility to sort by date applied and by distance.</li>
  <li>That will  be enough for today, more tomorrow.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Nodemon needs to stop being the runner on â€œnpm startâ€ of the backend.</li>
  <li>To see the instructions of the backend, it is necesary to put a / (backslash) at the end of the address otherwise is stuck on â€œloading..â€</li>
  <li>I canâ€™t do test-driven development in Angular because it requires an in-depth knowledge of the entire framework and thereâ€™s no time for it. So testing will be done in the browser by the user.</li>
</ul>
