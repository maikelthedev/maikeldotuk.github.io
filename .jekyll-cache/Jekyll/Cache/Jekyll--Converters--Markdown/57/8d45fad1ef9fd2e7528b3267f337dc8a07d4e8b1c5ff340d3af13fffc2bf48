<p>Iâ€™ve decided not to frustrate myself by thinking the worse. Iâ€™ve followed that way of doing stuff for too far and it will kill me.</p>

<p>Sure it worked when I was a teenager or much younger than now. But now that Iâ€™m almost 32 I can tell that it will hinder my health and Iâ€™ve got to change tactic to deal with life.</p>

<p>I used to think:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>La desesperaciÃ³n agudiza el ingenio</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is a Spanish saying that translates to something like â€œdesperation sharpens the intelligenceâ€. It used to apply for many years but now I think it simply isnâ€™t working. Now I think planning is what does the trick.</p>

<p>My best friend and I (remember I donâ€™t write names on this blog out of respect for other peopleâ€™s privacy) have talked a lot over this week about what are we going to do in regards to me moving there. Weâ€™re both on the same page scared of me not finding a job. Iâ€™m doing everything I can about it but I definitely know now that desperation wonâ€™t solve the problem.</p>

<p>At the same time I know the problem will be solved, I just donâ€™t know when and the longest it isnâ€™t solve the more time I would have wasted on this. Iâ€™ve got other stuff to get done, there are programming books Iâ€™ve got to read, there are programming languages Iâ€™ve got to master, Javascript frameworks Iâ€™ve got to use. I also want to get a grip on Ruby, one of the few languages I havenâ€™t given a try yet.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve got all these books to read</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2018/02/03/DVJY698WsAUE0jp.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are books on Java that Iâ€™ve read, one in Spring that I havenâ€™t started. One in Haskell that I had a look to update my knowledge on functional programming, one of C because I love it. Many on Angular, one of Docker, Swift, Python, and this isnâ€™t counting the ones Iâ€™ve got in my iPad.</p>

<p>In a nutshell <strong>there is a lot of pending stuff</strong> that is being delayed until I get a job. Because that is the maximum priority.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t even started at my university project or a TMA (tutor-marked assignment) that Iâ€™ve got to send before the 28th of this month.</p>
