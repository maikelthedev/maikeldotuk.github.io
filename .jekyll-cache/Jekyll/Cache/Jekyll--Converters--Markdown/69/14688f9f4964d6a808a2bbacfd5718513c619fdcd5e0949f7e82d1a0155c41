<p>Today I have had an exhausting day and I should never organise this poorly. Iâ€™ve decided to give up on the Meter Reader jobs (yep, plural, I was offered the other one too) and carry on with the P.A. / Support Worker role.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s just much more rewarding, itâ€™s not a dead-end job, I feel good doing it, I feel Iâ€™m not shitting on my CV but improving it while doing this job. Iâ€™m earning powerful skills and powerful experience to write down on it.</p>

<p>But in the morning I went to Eâ€™s place to clean up. Weâ€™ve arranged last week that I would go and clean up the house for 12 pounds an hour + transport, during 3 hours. Thatâ€™s a total of 40 pounds. Itâ€™s basically light clean the kitchen, deep clean the bathroom, change the bed sheets, hoover the entire flat and then iron their (he and his girlfriend) shirts.</p>

<p>Once it is all done he transfers me the money. I trust the guy because he was my roommate long time ago when I used to live in Bayswater on a hostel for long-stays (Leinster House). That means we know each other very well, we literally lived in the same room (not flat but room) for almost a year. Now heâ€™s got a job in the City and Iâ€™m about to finish my degree so weâ€™ve gone both far.</p>

<p>On this ocassion though, there were 18 shirts + a pair of trousers so we had to stretch it to 3 hours and 45 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="but-then-the-phone-beeped">But then the phone beepedâ€¦</h3>

<p>And a text message showed up from my new boss, letâ€™s call him B (of boss). He asked me to go to, letâ€™s call it TH to do 3 hours of admin tasks so there I went, after just half an hour to cook, eat, shower and change.</p>

<p>I went and I had an assigment of 89 pages of text that need to be proof-read and compared across an original. The text is written in a very simple English to be able to be read by people with cognitive or learning dissabilities (and other dissabilities) so I have also to check that it is well explained. It was a very interested read (I was loving it) yet I couldnâ€™t shake the though of the flat Iâ€™m moving in. The reason for it is that weâ€™ve started all the paperwork. The agency sent me today a link to LetRef, an online tool for agencies to automate the process of checking references of tenants.</p>

<h3 id="the-guarantor">The guarantor</h3>

<p>P (with whom I live) is going to be my guarantor since Iâ€™ve been living on an average of 500 pounds a month budget for almost two years since I started self-employment and that is not good for the estate agency.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t need a penny more because I donâ€™t currently pay rent nor bills so I, instead, invested my time in having the highest possible marks on my degree. <strong>Hence why Iâ€™ve got a guaranteed 2.1</strong> expecting me by September once I finish</p>

<p>Now that Iâ€™m going back to employment (without quitting the self-employed bit) it would be just stupid to lose that house so P is going to be my guarantor to give some peace of mind to the estate agency.</p>

<p>I feel like a lion in a cage, in fact that is exactly my profile image on Whatsapp. I need to relieve the pressure about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The flat.</li>
  <li>The rent of the flat</li>
  <li>The inestability of jobs</li>
  <li>The job search that never ends</li>
  <li>The project that needs continuous attention</li>
  <li>The TMA that needs to be finished before the 28th.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aw dear, dear, dearâ€¦.yeah, like the text above this is like having a bloody pyramid on top of my shoulders, not a stone.</p>

<h3 id="but-the-job-search-morphs">But the job search morphs</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m going to take a leap of faith and trust this job is going to be for 2 months at 21 or more hours. So Iâ€™m going to put it on my CV as experience as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal Assistance</li>
  <li>Support Worker</li>
  <li>Administrator</li>
  <li>Payroll</li>
  <li>Leads Genearator/Follower/chaser ?</li>
  <li>Webmaster</li>
</ul>

<p>Because thatâ€™s all the jobs that I would be doing with B. See why I want this job so badly, itâ€™s full of new skills and/or experience that I could <strong>now</strong> write down on the CV. With that itâ€™ll be easier to get into an admin, payroll jobs or even pursuing a career as P.A., which honestly sounds awesome. Itâ€™s so much better than a dead-end job because this provides a skillset.</p>

<p>That means Iâ€™ve got two months to do the best of this job and find the next one.</p>

<p>Best case scenario, I might not need a next one.</p>
