I"­<p>This is a blog in which I keep a log about how am I progressing with growing roots in London and especially my job search.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve lived in the UK since 2011 and since 2013 Iâ€™ve been a part time student of Computing Science. I came to the UK out of interest to improve my English but by 2013 it was good enough to progress into university.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been in many places not just London, I spend around 2 years in several cities on the North West, to come back on January 2015 to London and finally settle in Acton.</p>

<p>This is my final year at university and I intend to work in the IT industry once I finish it or earlier if Iâ€™m lucky. The roles Iâ€™m more interested in are Back-end JavaScript related and DevOps.</p>
