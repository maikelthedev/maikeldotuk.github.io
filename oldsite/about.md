This is a blog in which I keep a log about how am I progressing with growing roots in London and especially my job search.

I've lived in the UK since 2011 and since 2013 I've been a part time student of Computing Science. I came to the UK out of interest to improve my English but by 2013 it was good enough to progress into university.

I've been in many places not just London, I spend around 2 years in several cities on the North West, to come back on January 2015 to London and finally settle in Acton.

This is my final year at university and I intend to work in the IT industry once I finish it or earlier if I'm lucky. The roles I'm more interested in are Back-end JavaScript related and DevOps.
