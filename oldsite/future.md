Have you ever had to answer that ridiculous question of "where do you see yourself in 5 years" ? I have, I don't really like it. I can have a slight guideline of where I would like but I have no idea if that is were I am really heading or not. Some features have a high chance of becoming reality though.

## The NGO

I administer a kind of legendary Facebook group for Spanish speakers of all sort of countries that live in the UK. I focus in helping with bureaucratic issues, finding a job, getting the national insurance sorted, paying taxes and giving information about how to study in the UK. One of my articles for a fellow group with 60 thousand users have incited a couple of dozen users to study here.

I see myself making it a fully-fledge charity and offering a wide variety of services to help anyone, not only Spanish speakers, to settle here.

## The post-grad.

I do have a passion and I really want to dedicate my life to it. It goes beyond Computing, it is Cognitive Psychology and I want to very slowly study at least a Post-Grad Certificate on it. My interest is to reduce learning curves. I want to build a computing system that can help us learn any subject quicker or at the very least can help us retain the information we learn for longer.

## The employee job

I see myself as enjoying life in the office with my colleagues and progressing to senior roles in a major corporate firm that trusts me enough, because I've proven myself, to creatively solve their problems with code.
